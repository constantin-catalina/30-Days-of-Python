The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.  
To be, or not to be, that is the question.  
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer  
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,  
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles  
And by opposing end them.  
Be the change that you wish to see in the world.  
In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies,  
but the silence of our friends.  
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up.
